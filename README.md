## Game Description

Connect 5 requires two players for the game to operate. Player 1 starts off by dropping a token in an available column. Player 2 then drops a token in another available column. The two players interchange turns until one of the players gets 5 tokens in a row (the row can be in any direction, diagonals included). The game ends when a player got 5 tokens in a row, or both players have no more spots to drop a token in. The winner of the game is the first player to get to 5 tokens in a row first.

## Authors 

This version of Connect Five was created by a group of statistics and computer science students at the University of Toronto Mississauga. This project was done for credit for the course, CSC290: Communication Skills for Computer Scientists. Group members as well as their individual contributions, are listed below:

I was responsible for creating the GUI for this project. From developing the design before coding to implementing our team vision, my code contributions were primarily in the graphics department. I created both our design review and final presentation slides, so I was assigned a smaller amount of work for the README portion of this assignment. That being said, I set up the layout of the README on our Github page, handled the licensing, and wrote the section on how to extend the game. I also included a section detailing where users should look if they are looking to personalize our version of Connect Five. Finally, I looked over all the work for grammar and mechanics, and helped my teammates if needed.

I was put in charge of the won method and how the game would terminate if there was a winner or not. A case of their being no winner would only occur if the board is completely full and neither of the two players got 5 tokens in a row. The won function plays a big part in the games functionality and the game depends greatly on it. I also made a section that includes instructions on how users should install Connect 5 and how to play the game. I included screenshots to clearly show where the users should go and what they should do incase they do have any trouble following my instructions. Lastly, I made a section describing a project directory structure for the users who choose to enhance our code. This section will help them understand what our functions and classes are used for. Throughout the project, my teammates and I all took part in helping each other and taking responsibility when needed since we were down a member.
