## Authors 

This version of Connect Five was created by a group of statistics and computer science students at the University of Toronto Mississauga. This project was done for credit for the course, CSC290: Communication Skills for Computer Scientists. Group members as well as their individual contributions, are listed below:

I was responsible for creating the GUI for this project. From developing the design before coding to implementing our team vision, my code contributions were primarily in the graphics department. I created both our design review and final presentation slides, so I was assigned a smaller amount of work for the README portion of this assignment. That being said, I set up the layout of the README on our Github page, handled the licensing, and wrote the section on how to extend the game. I also included a section detailing where users should look if they are looking to personalize our version of Connect Five. Finally, I looked over all the work for grammar and mechanics, and helped my teammates if needed.
